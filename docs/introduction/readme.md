# Data & Analytics Framework (DAF)
The Data & Analytics Framework (DAF) is a combination of:
- A **Big Data Platform** to centralize and store (data lake), manipulate and standardize (data engine) and re-distribute (API & Data Application) data and insights.
- A **Data Team** (data scientists + data engineers) which uses and evolve the Big Data Platform to analyze data, create ML models and build data applications and data visualization products.

DAF has a twofold goal: 1. eliminate silos into which data are typically "trapped", and make entities be logically interconnected so to shed light on phenomena by looking at them via multiple perspectives; 2. easy analysts and data scientists make analysis and build applications that uses the insights from data to create "intelligent" services.
