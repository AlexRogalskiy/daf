# DAF - Data Management Architecture

We introduce the philosophy behind the data management architecture of the DAF platform describing the following topics:

- [*Dataset*](dataset) - the DAF platform revolves around the concept of dataset. In fact, all data stored in the DAF are organized into logical entities called dataset: as a consequence, it is crucial to understand how the concept of dataset is modelled in the DAF platform.  
- [*Metadata & Schemas*](dataset-metadata-schemas) - to describe the content and the structure of a dataset, the DAF platform specifies a minimum set of metadata, and additional metadata useful to homogenize the format of data collected from various datasources.
- [*Adding a new dataset*](dataset-adding)
- [*Data ingestion*](data-ingestion)
- [*Data at rest*](data-at-rest)
- [*Data in use*](data-in-use)
- [*Data egestion process and insight publication*](data-egestion).
